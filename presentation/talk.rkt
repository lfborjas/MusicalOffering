Yep, this presentation about Haskell is written in a Lisp.
Check out Racket's slideshow, it's neat!

Outline:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36ykl2tJwZM
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUHQ2ybTejU

* A tour of haskell basics
** Function application
** Basic syntax (precedence)
** Type annotations
** Local declarations
** Pattern matching
* A tour of Euterpea, and more haskell
* Playing some music
* But how? Polymorphic data types
* Some convenience functions
* Incremental problem solving
** How to write a simple melody
** How to write a simple canon
*** Unrolled: limited voices, instruments
*** List functions: deriving foldl
*** Partial application (currying)
*** List comprehension
*** Infinite sequences
*** All together: a more general canon
** Trying to solve Bach's crab canon.
* Conclusions:
** "Glue": things like higher order fns, partial application/lazy evaluation
   help define new solutions in terms of previous solutions.
** That's expressive, but also smart: phrase your problem in terms of already
   solved problems (the Birchbox Engineering way!)
** Maybe coding is like music: seeing patterns, putting them together.
